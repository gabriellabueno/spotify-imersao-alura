> **Spotify Landing Page Clone**


This project was developed during a 5-day immersion course organized by Alura.  
It involved recreating the landing page of Spotify, providing an oportunity for learning and practice in various Front-end technologies.

## :wrench: Technologies Used

* **HTML**: Structured the web content.
* **CSS**: Styled the web page.
* **JavaScript**: Added interactivity to the webpage.V
* **React**: Built the user interface with reusable components.
* **NodeJs**: Developed a local mock REST API from a JSON file.
* **Json**: Structure the fake database. 

## :white_check_mark: Tasks Completed

✔ Recreated the Spotify landing page.
✔ Added responsiveness to the project using **Media Queries**.
✔ Developed a mock API for local testing.

## :rocket: New Features

After the Alura Immersion, I've enhanced the project with new functionalities. 

The data for the fake API, previously kept localy, has been migrated to a **JSON Server** hosted on Vercel.  This API has two main endpoints: one for artists and another for playlists.

The data is fetched using hooks in React, simplifying the reuse of stateful logic between components without altering the component hierarchy. The application now communicates with two different endpoints of the Spotify fake API to fetch the required data.

## :triangular_flag_on_post: Next Steps

One of the primary goals for this project is to replace the current fake API with the **official Spotify API**. This will allow the application to interact with real Spotify data, enhancing the overall functionality and user experience. 

Stay tuned for updates on this project as I continue to work towards this goal!
